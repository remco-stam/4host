# 4host


Microarray experiment, comparing P. capsici gene expression on four different host species. 
Infected leaf material was sampled at 16 hours post inoculation and analised using an agilent array

Probes set was generated by using all known P. capsici genes (Phyca11) and additionally, all in house predicted RxLR and CRN effectors.
Overlaps (e.g. a gene annotated in Phyca11 and our predictions) were removed and replaced by our effectors.
